                <p class="definition">A systems analyst has many forecasting
                    models available. The main condition for choosing a model
                    is the availability of historical data.</p>
                <p class="definition">If historical data is unavailable, the
                    analyst must turn to one of the judgment methods: estimates
                    from the sales force, sureveys to estimate customer demand,
                    Delphi studies (a consensus forecast developed independently
                    by a group of experts through series of iteration)
                </p>
                <p class="definition">If historical data is available, the next
                    differentiation between classes of techniques involves whether
                    the forecast is conditional or unconditional.
                </p>
                <li>Identifying Benefits and Costs.</li>
                <p class="definition">TANGIBLE BENEFITS. Tangible benefits are
                    advantages that are measurable in dollars that accrue to
                    the organization through the use of the information system.
                    Examples of tangible benefits are an increase in the speed of
                    processing, access to otherwise inaccessible information,
                    access to information on a more timely basis than was possible
                    before, the advantage of the computer's superior calculating
                    power, and a decrease in the amount of employee time needed
                    to complete specific tasks.</p>
                <p class="definition">INTANGIBLE BENEFITS. Some benefits that
                    increase to an organization from the use of an information
                    system are difficult to measure but are important nonetheless.
                    They are known as intangible benefits. Intangible benefits
                    include improving the decision-making process, enhancing
                    accuracy, becoming more competitive in customer service,
                    maintaining a good business image, and increasing job
                    satisfaction for employees by eliminating tedious tasks.
                </p>
                <p class="definition">TANGIBLE COSTS. The concepts of tangible
                    and intangible costs present a conceptual parallel to the
                    tangible and intangible benefits discussed already. Tangible
                    costs are costs that a systems analyst and the business's
                    accounting personnel can accurately project. Included in
                    tangible costs are the cost of equipment such as computers
                    and terminals, the cost of resources, the cost em protes
                    salies These, costs are usual we estabisned or d at bee
                    discovered quite easily; they are costs that will require
                    the business to make a cash outlay.
                </p>
                <p class="definition">INTANGIBLE COSTS. Intangible costs are
                    difficult to estimate and may not be known. They include
                    losing a competitive edge, losing the reputation for being
                    first with an innovation or the leader in a field, declining
                    company image due to increased customer dissatisfaction,
                    and ineffective decision making due to untimely or
                    inaccessible information.

                <li>Comparing Costs and Benefits.</li>
                <p class="definition">BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS. By comparing costs
                    alone, a systems analyst can use break-even analysis to
                    determine the break-even capacity of a proposed information
                    system. The point at which the total costs of the current
                    system and the proposed system intersect represents the
                    break-even point, the point where it becomes profitable for
                    the business to get the new information system.

                <p class="definition">CASH-FLOW ANALYSIS. Cash-flow analysis
                    examines the direction, size, and pattern of the cash flow
                    associated with the proposed information system. If you are
                    proposing the replacement of an old information system with a
                    new one and if the new information system will not be
                    generating any additional cash for the business, only cash
                    outlays are associated with the project.

                <a href="10.png"><img src="10.png" alt=""></a>
                <p class="definition">PRESENT VALUE ANALYSIS. Present value
                    analysis helps a systems analyst present to business decision
                    makers the time value of the investment in the information
                    system as well as the cash flow (as discussed in the previous
                    section). Present value is a way to assess all the economic
                    outlays and revenues of the information system over its
                    economic life and to compare costs today with future costs and
                    today's benefits with future benefits.

                    accepted in the organization. For general guidelines, however, it is
                    safe to say the following:
                    1. Use break-even analysis if the project needs to be justified in terms of
                    cost, not benefits, or if benefits do not substantially improve with the
                    proposed system.
                    2. Use payback when the improved tangible benefits form a convincing
                    argument for the proposed system.
                    3. Use cash-flow analysis when the project is expensive relative to the
                    size of the company or when the business would be significantly affected
                    by a large drain (even if temporary) on funds.
                    4. Use present value analysis when the payback period is long or when
                    the cost of borrowing monev is high

                <li>The Word Breakdown Structure.</li>
                <p class="definition"> Systems analysts are responsible for completing projects on time and within
                    budget and for including the features promised. In order to accomplish all
                    three of these goals, a project needs to be broken down into smaller tasks or
                    activities. These tasks together make up a work breakdown structure (WBS).
                    When defined properly, the tasks that compose a work breakdown structure
                    have special properties:
                    1. Each task or activity contains one deliverable, or tangible outcome,
                    from the activity.
                    2. Each task can be assigned to a single individual or a single group.
                    3. Each task has a responsible person monitoring and controlling
                    performance.

                    <p class="definition"> The process of analysis and design can become
                        unwieldy, especially when the system being developed is large. To
                        keep the development activities as manageable as possible, you can
                        employ some of the techniques of project management to help get
                        organized. One of the difficult tasks is estimating the time it
                        takes to complete each of the tasks. There are numerous approaches:
                        1. Relying on experience
                        2. Using analogies
                        3. Using three-point estimation
                        4. Identifying function points
                        5. Using time estimation software

            <p class="definition"> Planning includes all the activities required to
                select a systems analysis team, assign members of the team to
                appropriate projects, estimate the time required to complete each
                task, and schedule the project so that tasks are completed in a
                timely fashion. Control means using feedback to monitor the project,
                including comparing the plan for the project with its actual
                evolution. In addition, control means taking appropriate action to
                expedite or reschedule activities to finish on time while motivating
                team members to complete the job properly.

                    The bottom-up approach to cost estimation: Often, an analyst is
                    faced with a project that requires something unique, such as
                    development in a different programming language. In this case,
                    the analyst needs to use a bottom-up approach. A systems analyst
                    can take the work breakdown structure and ask each responsible
                    project team member to estimate the cost involved with
                    completing the activity he or she is responsible for. This method,
                    however, yields estimates that are good or bad, depending on the
                    abilities of each team member.

                        Previous experience with estimating costs means a great deal, 
                        especially if the project you are attempting to estimate 
                        resembles a project you have previously worked on. If you've 
                        developed a website with similar features, then you can 
                        reliably estimate the costs of developing a new website. 
                        Customization is possible. The new website may feature a 
                        different number of products for sale, but it is possible to
                        adjust the costs accordingly. The bottom-up approach to cost

                        each of the many factors, or parameters, that make up a project.
                        For example, you can estimate that it will cost $75 per line of code
                        and $80 per hour for the programmers needed; you can then
                        estimate the lines of code and hours it will take to complete the
                        project.
